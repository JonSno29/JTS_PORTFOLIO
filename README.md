# JTS_PORTFOLIO

## OVERVIEW:

I am a motivated Coding Bootcamp student learning skills to become successful in the real world. In this challenge, I will be applying my new HTML and CSS skills to refactor an existing web page. The refactoring will result in improved accessibility and will optimize the page for search engines. Also, these changes will not change the display of the web page; Only the underlying code.

## User Story

AS AN employer

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
