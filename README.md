# JTS_PORTFOLIO

## OVERVIEW:

I am a motivated Coding Bootcamp student learning skills to become successful in the real world. In this challenge, I will be applying my new HTML and CSS skills to refactor an existing web page. The refactoring will result in improved accessibility and will optimize the page for search engines. Also, these changes will not change the display of the web page; Only the underlying code.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards;
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the icon and image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
